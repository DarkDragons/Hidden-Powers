The mod will add Compressed Obsidian which you will use to craft Bedrock. It adds Obsidian Ingots to craft tools with speeds higher than diamond. With Bedrock and a Nether Star, you can the Ender Staff. It's a bow, it's a death wand, and it's best pickaxe in the game. 100% Guaranteed! (Fortune Not Included).

Please see the wiki for more information on the mod.

Please Note: This Mod is Still Early in its development and as such updates have the potential to break your world. I will try to post a note in the description if this will be the case, but it is recommended that you make a backup of your world just in case. After such an update, you will likely need to cheat back in an item or block, if not worse.

Thermal Expansion or Ender IO is recommended for the RF/FE option and better balancing.

NOTE: I am aware that TE and Ender IO are not out yet for 1.14, so until then, this mod probably isn't viable.
