# Void's Mysteries

**All versions prior to 1.14 go by the name Lost Powers. I am skipping 1.13 for now, but once I have finished porting to 1.14, might back-port due to the similarity to 1.12**

Void's Mysteries adds Compressed Obsidian which you will use to craft Bedrock. It adds Obsidian Ingots to craft tools with speeds higher than diamond. With Bedrock and a couple of Dragons Hearts, you can craft the Ender Staff. It's a bow, it's a death wand, striking down even the most powerful of foes, and it's a godly hand, capable of instantaneously collecting any block. 100% Guaranteed (Fortune Not Included).

## Pre 1.14
**Required Forge Version: 1.12.2-14.23.4.2747**

Thermal Expansion or Ender IO is recommended for the RF/FE option and better balancing
 
At the moment, there are some major balancing issues with ProjectE.
