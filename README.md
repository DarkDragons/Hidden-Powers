# Hidden Powers

Hidden Powers is a mod that adds compressed obsidian that goes until it is compressed four times and then you can craft a singularity. A singularity is a point where matter is infinitly dense. Unfortunatly, I cannot make this a small circle. I will soon add tools, weapons and armor to go along with everything else.
